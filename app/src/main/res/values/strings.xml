    <string name="info_text">Drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day is essential
        for maintaining good health and hydration. Make sure to drink water regularly
        throughout the day, monitor the quality of your drinking water, and avoid relying
        on sugary drinks. During exercise, drink water before, during, and after to stay hydrated,
        and watch for signs of dehydration. Avoid overhydration as it can be dangerous.
        In addition to drinking enough water, it is important to pay attention to the quality of
        your drinking water. If you are not sure about the quality of your tap water, consider using
        a water filter or drinking bottled water. It is also important to be aware of the signs of
        dehydration, such as thirst, dry mouth, dark urine, fatigue, and headache, and to drink water
        immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.

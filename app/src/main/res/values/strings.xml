        for maintaining good health and hydration. Make sure to drink water regularly
        throughout the day, monitor the quality of your drinking water, and avoid relying
        on sugary drinks. During exercise, drink water before, during, and after to stay hydrated,
        and watch for signs of dehydration. Avoid overhydration as it can be dangerous.
        In addition to drinking enough water, it is important to pay attention to the quality of
        your drinking water.
